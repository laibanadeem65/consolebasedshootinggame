ðŸš€ Just Built a Console Shooting Game in C++!

Proud to share my latest mini-project: a 2D side-scrolling shooting game made entirely in C++ using just the console. The player controls a spaceship (>) that shoots bullets (-) to destroy incoming enemies (<). It features:
âœ… Real-time input
âœ… Colored graphics
âœ… Moving enemies & bullet collision
âœ… Score tracking & game over logic

It was a fun way to practice game loops, arrays, collision detection, and console graphics!

ðŸ”§ Tools used: C++, conio.h, windows.h, and pure logic.

ðŸ’¬ Try it out or give feedbackâ€”always looking to improve!
